DrupalPro14
===========

This is a collection of shell script that can be run in a clean installation of Ubuntu 14.04 (64bits) desktop edition in order to build a Drupal development environment similar to the pre-configured development environment that was offered for download as a VirtualBox image for Ubuntu 12.04 (32bit).

This work is derived from the QuickStrat and DrupalPro projects (see credits below).

This code has been tested in a VirtualBox machine but should work in a physical machine after applying some security hardening to the system.

#How to use

##Install Ubuntu

Install Ubuntu 14.04 (64bits) Desktop Edition on your computer.

IMPORTANT: During the installation you will be asked to create a user account. Make sure that the username for this account is: drupalpro

Once the installation is done login to your new system using your "drupalpro" account and the password that you selected.

Note: If you install Ubuntu in a VirtualBox machine you may want to install also the VirtualBox guest additions. If you are installing in a physical machine ignore this note. 

##Update Ubuntu for the first time

Open the terminal by pressing Ctrl+Alt+t and type the following two commands:

 sudo apt-get update

 sudo apt-get upgrade

##Retrieve this code using Git

###Install Git

In the terminal type:

 sudo apt-get install git

###Retrieve this code

In the terminal type:

 git clone https://github.com/jcmartinez/drupalpro14.git ~/drupalpro_install

##Run the configuration scripts

In the terminal navigate to the directory where you just cloned the installation scripts:

 cd ~/drupalpro_install

There are two ways of running the scripts that will set Drupalpro for you (use only one):

A) The fast way - If you want to run all the scripts at once use the run_all.sh script as follows:

 bash run_all.sh

B) The selective way - Run the configuration scripts one-by-one. A good reason for doing so is if you would like to keep the office software that comes with Ubuntu; in this case you would run the scripts as explained below with the exception of 1-cleanup.sh because this script will erase the office package, games, etc. Aother reason could be that you prefer installing a diffrent IDE and don't want to install Netbeans, in this case you don't need to run the script 4-install-betbeans.sh. In case you want to be selective do as follows:

bash 0-preparation.sh

bash 1-cleanup.sh

bash 2-install-lamp.sh

bash 3-install-miscellaneous.sh

bash 4-install-netbeans.sh

bash 5-install-drush.sh

##Create your first Drupal site

In your terminal navigate to the "websites" directory:

cd ~/websites

... and run the following command to install a Website:

drush qc all --domain=d7.dev --codepath=/home/drupalpro/websites/d7.dev --makefile=/home/drupalpro/make_templates/d7.make --profile=standard

Now you should be able to visit your website using a browser and typing http://d7.dev in the address bar.

If you want to install another site use the same command above and modify the variables --domain and --codepath.

#ToDos

So far only one IDE environment (Netbeans) has been installed. If you know how to script the installation of other environments please fork this code and it will be added.
